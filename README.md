# DnD_False_Hydra_One_Shot_Demo
DnD Adventure Game Demo

This is a Demo and does not reflect the complete game.

In this demo the user is able to start/load their game from the main menu. First time users will start their adventure here.

Once in game, the user is able to traverse the map(s). At current there are 3 sections the user can explore. These can be accessed by going North/touching the top of the screen with the user's sprite. If the user goes beyond the 3rd (most North map), down past the 1st, or left/right of the current map it will break the game.

The user can save the game, and it will keep their current location, and area they are in. If you goto the bag it will open another screen where the user can choose to go back or go to the main menu. After the user has a save, they can then access that save from the main menu by clicking the load option.

The bottom left button currently is a placeholder that allows the user to delete their save file by clearing the game data.
